# Verilog
This repository contains a collection of small Verilog modules and mini-projects, created for practice and educational purposes. Each project is implemented in a modular and understandable format, suitable for beginners and intermediate learners of digital design using Verilog.
Project structure: 
1. ripple4bit_adder
Description: Implements a 4 bit ripple carry adder.
Purpose: Demonstrates a basic combinational circuit design using structural modeling.

2.singleclockfifo
Description: Implements a single clock (synchronous fifo)
Purpose: Shows how to design a synchronous FIFO where both read and write instructions are driven by the same clock.

3. 32bitadder
Description: Implements a 32 bit adder.
Purpose: Extends the idea of simple adders to wider word lengths.

4. array_mul4bit
Description: Implements a 4 bit Array Multiplier.
Purpose: Introduces basic multiplication in hardware using array logic.
