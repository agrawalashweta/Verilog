# Verilog
This repository contains a collection of small Verilog modules and mini-projects, created for practice and educational purposes. Each project is implemented in a modular and understandable format, suitable for beginners and intermediate learners of digital design using Verilog.
Project structure: 
1. ripple4bit_adder

**Description**: Implements a 4 bit ripple carry adder.
**Purpose**: Demonstrates a basic combinational circuit design using structural modeling.

2. singleclockfifo

**Description**: Implements a single clock (synchronous fifo).
**Purpose**: Shows how to design a synchronous FIFO where both read and write instructions are driven by the same clock.

3. 32bitadder

**Description**: Implements a 32 bit adder.
**Purpose**: Extends the idea of simple adders to wider word lengths.

4. array_mul4bit

**Description**: Implements a 4 bit Array Multiplier.
**Purpose**: Introduces basic multiplication in hardware using array logic.

5. vedic4bit

**Description**: Implements a 4 bit array multiplier using the vedic multiplication method.
**Purpose**: Introduces advanced methods like vedic method to multiply, easier since it's reuses modules made before.

6. barrelshifter8bit

**Description**: Implements a 8 bit barrel shifter using 2x1 mux.
**Purpose**: It has both shift left and shift right modules, helps understand concepts of mux better.
